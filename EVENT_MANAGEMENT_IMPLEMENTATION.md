# Event Management System Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive event management system in the EventsScreen that allows event organizers and owners to create, read, update, and delete events. Here's what's been added:

## New Features

### 1. **User Role-Based Access Control**
- **Event Organizers** (`userRole === 'event-organizer'`) can manage events
- **Owners** (`userRole === 'owner'`) can also manage events
- **Customers** can view and mark attendance but cannot create/edit events

### 2. **Enhanced Event Filtering**
- **Upcoming Events**: Events scheduled for today and future dates
- **Past Events**: Events that have already occurred
- **Attended Events**: Events the user has marked as attended
- **My Events**: Events created by the current user (only visible to event organizers/owners)

### 3. **Create Event Functionality**
- Comprehensive event creation form with:
  - **Event Title** (required)
  - **Description** (optional)
  - **Event Type** (food-festival, farmers-market, street-fair, popup-event, catering, private-event)
  - **Date & Time** (with native date/time pickers)
  - **Location** (required) and full address
  - **Max Attendees** (optional)
  - **Organizer Logo URL** (optional)
  - **Event Status** (upcoming, active, completed, cancelled)

### 4. **Edit Event Functionality**
- Event organizers can edit their own events
- Pre-populated form with existing event data
- Same comprehensive form as creation
- Real-time updates reflected on map and event list

### 5. **Delete Event Functionality**
- Event organizers can delete their own events
- Confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion
- Immediate removal from all views

### 6. **Enhanced Event Cards**
- **Edit Button**: Quick access to edit modal for event organizers
- **Management Buttons**: Edit and Delete buttons for owned events
- **Better Date Handling**: Supports both Firestore Timestamps and regular dates
- **Event Type Display**: Formatted event type names
- **Max Attendees**: Display attendee limits when set

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Updates
Events now support these fields:
```javascript
{
  title: string (required)
  description: string
  eventType: string (enum)
  startDate: Firestore Timestamp (required)
  endDate: Firestore Timestamp (optional)
  time: string (HH:MM format)
  endTime: string (HH:MM format)
  location: string (required)
  address: string
  latitude: number
  longitude: number
  maxAttendees: number
  registrationRequired: boolean
  organizerLogoUrl: string
  status: string (upcoming/active/completed/cancelled)
  organizerId: string (user.uid)
  organizerName: string
  organizerEmail: string
  createdAt: Firestore Timestamp
  updatedAt: Firestore Timestamp
}
```

### New Dependencies
- `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`: For native date and time selection
- Enhanced Firebase Firestore operations for CRUD functionality

### Security & Permissions
- Users can only edit/delete events they created (`event.organizerId === user.uid`)
- Role-based UI rendering (Create button only shows for authorized users)
- Firestore security rules should enforce these permissions on the backend

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. **Intuitive UI**
- **Create Button**: Prominently displayed in header for authorized users
- **Filter Tabs**: Dynamic tabs based on user role
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages and quick action buttons

### 2. **Native Components**
- **Date/Time Pickers**: Native iOS/Android pickers for better UX
- **Modal Forms**: Full-screen modal for comfortable form filling
- **Touch Feedback**: Proper button states and animations

### 3. **Form Validation**
- Required field validation
- Numeric input filtering for attendee limits
- URL validation for logo fields

## Integration with Map
The events created through this system will automatically appear on the MapScreen with:
- **Custom Icons**: Using organizer logos when provided
- **Event Markers**: Distinct from food truck markers
- **Event Details**: Popup information matching the event data
- **Real-time Updates**: New events appear immediately without app restart

## Usage Instructions

### For Event Organizers:
1. **Create Event**: Tap the "+" button in the header
2. **Fill Form**: Complete the event details form
3. **Save**: Tap "Save" to create the event
4. **Manage**: Switch to "My Events" tab to see your events
5. **Edit**: Tap the edit icon or "Edit" button on your events
6. **Delete**: Tap "Delete" button with confirmation

### For Customers:
1. **Browse Events**: Use filter tabs to find events
2. **View Details**: Tap on event cards for more information
3. **Mark Attendance**: Use "Mark as Attended" for events you visit
4. **Track History**: Use "Attended" tab to see your event history

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements:
1. **Image Upload**: Add event photo upload functionality
2. **Location Picker**: Integrate with map for precise location selection
3. **Push Notifications**: Notify users of new events in their area
4. **Event Registration**: Full registration system with attendee management
5. **Event Analytics**: Track event performance and attendance metrics
6. **Recurring Events**: Support for recurring event creation
7. **Event Search**: Search and filter by keywords, location, date range

### Backend Security:
Ensure Firestore security rules enforce:
```javascript
// Only event organizers can create events
// Only event creators can edit/delete their events
// All users can read public events
```

This implementation provides a solid foundation for event management that can be extended with additional features as needed.
