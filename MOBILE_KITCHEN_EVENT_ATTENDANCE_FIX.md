# Mobile Kitchen Event Attendance Fix

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **"Mark as Attended" Button Visibility**
**Problem**: Mobile kitchen owners couldn't see the "Mark as Attended" button for events they could edit (events they organized).

**Solution**: Removed the `!canEdit` condition from button visibility logic.

**Before**:
```javascript
{!attended && !isPast && !canEdit && (
  <TouchableOpacity style={styles.attendButton}>
    <Text>Mark as Attended</Text>
  </TouchableOpacity>
)}
```

**After**:
```javascript
{!attended && !isPast && (
  <TouchableOpacity style={styles.attendButton}>
    <Text>Mark as Attended</Text>
  </TouchableOpacity>
)}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Attendance Tracking for Mobile Kitchen Owners**
**Improvements**:
- Added better user name detection (businessName, truckName, username)
- Added `userRole` field to attendance records for better tracking
- Enhanced logging for debugging mobile kitchen owner attendance
- Better error handling and user feedback

**New Attendance Record Structure**:
```javascript
{
  userId: "mobile_kitchen_owner_uid",
  userEmail: "owner@example.com", 
  userName: "Joe's Food Truck", // businessName || truckName || username
  userRole: "owner", // Added for better tracking
  eventId: "event_123",
  eventTitle: "Food Festival",
  eventDate: timestamp,
  eventLocation: "Downtown Park",
  organizerId: "organizer_uid",
  attendedAt: serverTimestamp(),
  attendanceMethod: "manual",
  rating: null,
  review: null
}
```

### 3. **"Remove Attendance" Button Fix**
**Problem**: Mobile kitchen owners couldn't remove their attendance from events they organized.

**Solution**: Removed `!canEdit` condition from "Remove Attendance" button as well.

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works Now

1. **View Events**: Can see all events (upcoming, past, attended, my-events)
