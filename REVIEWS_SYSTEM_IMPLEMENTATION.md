# ‚≠ê Reviews System Implementation Summary

## üéØ **What Was Implemented:**

### **Reviews Button**
- Added **Reviews Button** in the truck modal header buttons section
- Shows for ALL users (customers, owners, event organizers)
- Positioned alongside Menu, Favorite, Cart, and Book Catering buttons
- **Icon**: Star icon with "Reviews" text

### **Complete Reviews System**
1. **Read Reviews** - View all reviews for any food truck
2. **Write Reviews** - Customers can submit star ratings (1-5) + written reviews
3. **Star Rating System** - Interactive 5-star rating with visual feedback
4. **Average Rating Display** - Shows overall rating and review count in modal header
5. **Review Validation** - One review per customer per truck, prevents self-reviews

## üì± **User Experience:**

### **For Customers:**
- Can view all reviews for any food truck
- Can submit one review per truck with 1-5 star rating + comment
- Cannot review their own truck (if they're also an owner)
- Form validation ensures meaningful reviews

### **For Food Truck Owners:**
- Can view all reviews for their truck and others
- Cannot submit reviews for their own truck
- Get valuable customer feedback for business improvement

### **For Event Organizers:**
- Can view reviews to help select quality food trucks for events
- Can leave reviews for trucks they've worked with

## üîß **Technical Implementation:**

### **Frontend (React Native):**
- **File Modified**: `grubana-mobile/src/screens/MapScreen.js`
- **New State Variables**:
  - `showReviewsModal` - Controls reviews modal visibility
  - `reviews` - Array of reviews for current truck
  - `loadingReviews` - Loading state for reviews
  - `newReview` - Form data for new review submission
  - `submittingReview` - Loading state for review submission

### **Key Functions:**
- `loadReviews(truckId)` - Fetches reviews from Firestore
- `submitReview()` - Validates and submits new review
- `renderStarRating()` - Renders interactive star rating component
- `getAverageRating()` - Calculates average rating from reviews

### **Firebase Integration:**
- **Collection**: `reviews`
- **Document Structure**:
  ```javascript
  {
    truckId: string,        // Owner UID of the truck
    truckName: string,      // Display name of truck
    userId: string,         // Reviewer's UID
    userName: string,       // Reviewer's display name
    rating: number,         // 1-5 star rating
    comment: string,        // Written review text
    createdAt: timestamp    // When review was created
  }
  ```

### **Security Rules:**
- Users can only create one review per truck
- Users cannot review their own trucks
- Everyone can read reviews
- Users can only edit/delete their own reviews

### **Database Indexes:**
- `truckId + createdAt (DESC)` - For loading reviews by truck
- `truckId + userId` - For checking existing user reviews

## üé® **UI/UX Features:**

### **Reviews Modal:**
- Clean, professional design matching app aesthetic
- **Header**: Shows truck name, average rating, and total review count
- **Write Review Section**: Star picker + text input (customers only)
- **Reviews List**: Scrollable list of all reviews with ratings

### **Star Rating Component:**
- Interactive gold stars for rating input
- Read-only display for existing reviews
- Visual feedback with filled/outlined stars

### **Form Validation:**
- Requires comment text (max 500 characters)
- Shows character count
- Prevents duplicate reviews per user/truck
- Loading states during submission

## üöÄ **Benefits:**

1. **Customer Trust**: Reviews build confidence in food truck quality
2. **Business Improvement**: Owners get valuable feedback
3. **Event Planning**: Organizers can select highly-rated trucks
4. **Community Building**: Encourages engagement between customers and vendors
5. **Quality Control**: Poor-performing trucks are highlighted for improvement
