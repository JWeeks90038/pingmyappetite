## ‚úÖ Book Catering & Menu Buttons Implementation Summary

### üéØ **What Was Implemented:**

1. **Menu Button** - Now shows on ALL food truck modals
   - **Before**: Only showed if `selectedTruck?.menuUrl` existed  
   - **After**: Shows on every truck modal
   - **Function**: Scrolls down to the menu section within the modal
   - **Icon**: Restaurant icon with "Menu" text

2. **Book Catering Button** - Now shows on ALL food truck modals  
   - **Before**: Only showed for non-owners (`selectedTruck?.ownerId !== user?.uid`)
   - **After**: Shows on every truck modal  
   - **Function**: Opens catering request form that emails the truck owner
   - **Icon**: Calendar icon with "Book Catering" text

### üì± **Button Layout:**
```
[Menu] [Pre-order Cart] [Book Catering]
```

### üîß **Backend Integration:**

#### **Menu Button:**
- Uses existing `scrollToMenuSection()` function
- Scrolls to `menuSectionRef` in the modal
- Works even for trucks without menu items (shows "Add Menu Items" section)

#### **Book Catering Button:**
- Opens existing catering modal with form fields:
  - Customer Name*, Email*, Phone*
  - Event Date*, Time*, Location*  
  - Guest Count*, Special Requests
- Submits via Firebase Function: `sendCateringRequest`
- **Email Service**: Uses SendGrid via `cateringEmailService.js`
- **Firestore**: Saves request to `cateringRequests` collection
- **Owner Email**: Automatically fetched from Firestore using `ownerId`

### üé® **Styling:**
- Both buttons use consistent styling with:
  - White background with green border (`#2c6f57`)
  - Shadow/elevation effects
  - Icons + text layout
  - Same size and spacing as existing buttons

### üìß **Email Functionality:**
- **Service**: SendGrid email service (already configured)
- **Template**: Professional catering request email to truck owner
- **Data**: Includes all customer details and event information
- **Response**: Success confirmation shown to customer

### üöÄ **Benefits:**

1. **Consistent UX**: All trucks now have the same button layout
2. **No Conditions**: Buttons appear regardless of:
   - Whether the truck has a menu URL
   - Whether you're the owner or customer  
   - User role or plan type
3. **Full Functionality**: Complete catering booking workflow
4. **Professional**: Automated email system for catering requests
