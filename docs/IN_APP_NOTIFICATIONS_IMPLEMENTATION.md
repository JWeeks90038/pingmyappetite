# In-App Notification System Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive in-app notification system that has been implemented for both mobile kitchen owners and customers.

## System Components

### 1. Firebase Cloud Functions (Backend)
- **`onOrderCreated`**: Triggers when a new order is placed, notifies truck owners
- **`onOrderStatusChanged`**: Triggers when order status changes, notifies customers
- **`orderNotificationService.js`**: Handles all notification logic and delivery

### 2. Mobile App Notification Service
- **`notificationService.js`**: Expo notifications integration
- **Automatic permission requests**: On user login
- **Token management**: Saves both `expoPushToken` and `fcmToken` for compatibility

### 3. Order Management Screens
- **`OrderManagementScreen.js`**: For truck owners to manage incoming orders
- **`CustomerOrdersScreen.js`**: For customers to track their orders

## Notification Flow

### When a Customer Places an Order
1. Order is created in Firebase `orders` collection
2. `onOrderCreated` Cloud Function triggers automatically
3. Function looks up truck owner's notification preferences
4. Sends push notification to truck owner: "üöö New Order Received! Order #ABC123 from John ‚Ä¢ $24.99"
5. Truck owner sees notification on their device and in the Orders tab

### When Truck Owner Updates Order Status
1. Truck owner marks order as "confirmed", "preparing", "ready", or "completed"
2. `onOrderStatusChanged` Cloud Function triggers automatically
3. Function looks up customer's notification preferences
4. Sends push notification to customer with appropriate message:
   - Confirmed: "‚úÖ Order Confirmed! Taco Truck confirmed your order #ABC123 ‚Ä¢ ~15 min"
   - Preparing: "üë®‚Äçüç≥ Order Being Prepared"
   - Ready: "üîî Order Ready! Your order #ABC123 from Taco Truck is ready for pickup!"
   - Completed: "‚úÖ Order Complete"

## Technical Details

### Notification Types
```javascript
// For truck owners (new orders)
{
  title: 'üöö New Order Received!',
  body: 'New order #ABC123 from John ‚Ä¢ $24.99',
  data: { type: 'new_order', orderId: 'ABC123' }
}

// For customers (order status updates)
{
  title: 'üîî Order Ready!',
  body: 'Your order #ABC123 from Taco Truck is ready for pickup!',
  data: { type: 'order_status', orderId: 'ABC123', status: 'ready' }
}
```

### Status Flow
```
pending ‚Üí confirmed ‚Üí preparing ‚Üí ready ‚Üí completed
    ‚Üì         ‚Üë          ‚Üë         ‚Üë
 cancelled    ‚Üê          ‚Üê         ‚Üê
```

### Navigation Integration
- **Truck Owners**: Orders tab added to main navigation
- **Customers**: My Orders tab added to main navigation
- **Auto-initialization**: Notifications set up automatically on login

## Testing Instructions

### Testing Truck Owner Notifications
1. Log in as a customer on one device/account
2. Log in as a truck owner on another device/account
3. Place an order as the customer
4. Truck owner should receive immediate push notification
5. Check Orders tab on truck owner app to see the new order

### Testing Customer Notifications
1. As truck owner, open Orders tab
2. Tap on a pending order
3. Mark it as "Confirmed" ‚Üí Customer gets notification
4. Mark it as "Preparing" ‚Üí Customer gets notification  
5. Mark it as "Ready" ‚Üí Customer gets special "ready for pickup" notification
6. Mark it as "Completed" ‚Üí Customer gets completion notification

### Testing Push Notifications
- Both screens have a notification icon in the header for manual testing
- Tap the icon to send a test notification to verify the system works

## Configuration Requirements

### Mobile App
- ‚úÖ `expo-notifications` package installed
- ‚úÖ `expo-device` package installed
- ‚úÖ Notification permissions requested on login
- ‚úÖ Token saved to Firestore user document

### Firebase
- ‚úÖ Cloud Functions deployed with notification triggers
- ‚úÖ Firestore security rules allow notification token updates
- ‚úÖ Expo project ID configured for push tokens

## Deployment Status
- ‚úÖ Firebase Cloud Functions deployed and active
- ‚úÖ Mobile app notification service integrated
- ‚úÖ Order management screens added to navigation
- ‚úÖ Real-time listeners set up for order updates
- ‚úÖ Notification system fully operational

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- [ ] Sound customization for different notification types
- [ ] Rich notifications with images
- [ ] Notification history/inbox
- [ ] Email notifications as backup
- [ ] SMS notifications integration
- [ ] Admin notification dashboard
- [ ] Notification analytics and metrics

## Troubleshooting

### If Notifications Don't Work
1. Check device notification permissions
2. Verify user is logged in and token is saved to Firestore
3. Check Firebase Cloud Function logs for errors
4. Ensure orders are being created with correct `truckId` and `customerId`
5. Test with the test notification buttons first

### Common Issues
- **No permission**: App will request on login, user must grant
- **No token**: Check Firestore user document for `expoPushToken` field
- **Functions not triggering**: Check Firebase Console function logs
- **Wrong notifications**: Verify `truckId` matches truck owner's user ID

The notification system is now fully implemented and operational! üéâ
