# Quick Testing Guide for In-App Notifications

## Ready to Test! 🚀

Your in-app notification system is now fully implemented and deployed. Here's how to test it:

## Test Setup
1. **Two devices/accounts needed:**
   - Account A: Customer account
   - Account B: Truck owner account

## Test Scenario 1: New Order Notification (Truck Owner)

### Steps:
1. **Login as Customer (Account A)**
   - Open the mobile app
   - Navigate to Map tab
   - Find a food truck
   - Add items to cart and place an order

2. **Check Truck Owner (Account B)**
   - Should receive push notification: "🚚 New Order Received! Order #ABC123 from [Customer] • $XX.XX"
   - Open app → Orders tab
   - See the new order listed with "PENDING" status

### Expected Result:
✅ Truck owner gets immediate notification when customer places order

## Test Scenario 2: Order Status Updates (Customer)

### Steps:
1. **As Truck Owner (Account B)**
   - Go to Orders tab
   - Tap on the pending order
   - Tap "Confirm Order" button

2. **Check Customer (Account A)**
   - Should receive notification: "✅ Order Confirmed! [Truck Name] confirmed your order #ABC123"
   - Go to My Orders tab
   - See order status changed to "CONFIRMED"

3. **Continue Testing Status Updates:**
   - Mark as "Preparing" → Customer gets "👨‍🍳 Order Being Prepared"
   - Mark as "Ready" → Customer gets "🔔 Order Ready! Your order is ready for pickup!"
   - Mark as "Completed" → Customer gets "✅ Order Complete"

### Expected Results:
✅ Customer gets real-time notifications for each status change

## Test Scenario 3: Manual Test Notifications

### Steps:
1. **For Truck Owners:**
   - Go to Orders tab
   - Tap the notification bell icon in header
   - Should see test notification: "🚚 New Order Received! New order #ABC123 from John • $24.99"

2. **For Customers:**
   - Go to My Orders tab  
   - Tap the notification bell icon in header
   - Should see test notification: "🔔 Order Ready! Your order from Taco Truck is ready for pickup!"

### Expected Result:
✅ Test notifications work on both sides

## Troubleshooting

### If Notifications Don't Appear:
1. **Check Permissions:**
   - Device Settings → [App Name] → Notifications → Ensure enabled
   - The app requests permission automatically on login

2. **Check Login:**
   - Ensure user is logged in (notifications only work for authenticated users)
   - Check that notification token is saved (happens automatically)

3. **Check Orders:**
   - Ensure orders have correct `truckId` and `customerId`
   - Orders should appear in respective tabs

4. **Firebase Functions:**
   - Functions are deployed and should trigger automatically
   - Check Firebase Console for any function errors

### Common Issues:
- **No notification permission**: Grant permission in device settings
- **Wrong truck/customer**: Ensure order is placed for the correct truck owner
- **App in background**: Notifications should work in foreground and background
