# Smart Estimated Time System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented an intelligent estimated preparation time system that automatically calculates order preparation times based on multiple factors, with manual override capabilities for mobile kitchen owners.

## Features Implemented

### üß† **Smart Calculation Algorithm**
The system automatically calculates estimated preparation time considering:

#### **Item Complexity Analysis**
- **Quick items** (1-2 min): Drinks, snacks, chips, cookies
- **Medium complexity** (3-7 min): Sandwiches, burgers, wraps, salads, sides
- **Complex items** (8-15 min): Pizza, pasta, grilled items, BBQ, specials
- **Quantity scaling**: Diminishing returns for bulk orders (70% additional time per extra item)

#### **Time-of-Day Multipliers**
- **Breakfast rush** (7-9 AM): 1.2x multiplier
- **Lunch rush** (11 AM-1 PM): 1.4x multiplier  
- **Dinner rush** (5-7 PM): 1.3x multiplier
- **Late night** (10 PM-6 AM): 1.1x multiplier
- **Off-peak hours**: 1.0x (no change)

#### **Queue Impact**
- Adds preparation time based on current pending/confirmed/preparing orders
- 30% additional time per order in queue with diminishing returns

#### **Day-of-Week Factors**
- **Weekends**: 1.1x multiplier (busier periods)
- **Mondays**: 0.95x multiplier (slower start)
- **Other weekdays**: 1.0x (standard)

#### **Smart Bounds**
- **Minimum**: 5 minutes (even for simple orders)
- **Maximum**: 60 minutes (prevents unrealistic estimates)
- **Rounding**: Results rounded to nearest 5 minutes for better UX

### üì± **Mobile Kitchen Owner Interface**

#### **Order Cards Display**
- Shows estimated time with orange clock icon: `‚è±Ô∏è Est. time: 15min`
- Indicates if time has been manually adjusted: `(adjusted)`
- Clickable time button for quick override access

#### **Time Override Modal**
- **Smart suggestions**: Express, Fast, Calculated (default), Conservative, Extended, Busy period
- **Visual feedback**: Clearly marked auto-calculated option
- **Order context**: Shows current order details and existing estimate
- **One-tap adjustment**: Quick selection with visual confirmation

#### **Detailed Order View**
- **Full breakdown**: Shows calculation factors when auto-calculated
- **Override history**: Indicates when time was manually adjusted
- **Quick adjust button**: Direct access to time override from order details

### üë• **Customer Experience**
- **Clear expectations**: Customers see estimated time with their order
- **Real-time updates**: Time updates are immediately visible to customers
- **Status integration**: Estimated time shown until order is completed

### üîß **Technical Implementation**

#### **Files Created/Modified**
1. **`estimatedTimeCalculator.js`** - Core calculation logic
2. **`MapScreen.js`** - Order creation with estimated time
3. **`OrderManagementScreen.js`** - Time override interface
4. **`CustomerOrdersScreen.js`** - Customer time display

#### **Database Schema Changes**
```javascript
// Order document fields
{
  estimatedPrepTime: 15,                    // Final estimated minutes
  estimatedTimeCalculation: {              // Breakdown for transparency
    baseTime: 10,
    timeOfDayFactor: 1.4,
    queueFactor: 1.0,
    dayFactor: 1.0,
    currentOrders: 0,
    complexity: 14
  },
  estimatedTimeDescription: "15 min - Standard",
  isEstimatedTimeOverridden: false,        // Manual adjustment flag
  timeOverriddenAt: timestamp,             // When manually changed
  timeOverriddenBy: "userId"               // Who made the change
}
```

## Usage Examples

### **Automatic Calculation Examples**

#### Simple Order (Off-Peak)
```
2x Classic Burger at 3:00 PM, no queue
‚Ä¢ Base: 14 minutes (7min √ó 2 √ó 0.7 diminishing returns)
‚Ä¢ Time factor: 1.0x (off-peak)
‚Ä¢ Queue factor: 1.0x (no queue)
‚Ä¢ Result: 15 minutes (rounded to nearest 5)
```

#### Complex Order (Rush Hour)
```
1x Pizza + 2x Grilled Chicken + 3x Fries at 12:30 PM, 3 orders ahead
‚Ä¢ Base: 26 minutes (complex items)
‚Ä¢ Time factor: 1.4x (lunch rush)
‚Ä¢ Queue factor: 1.9x (3 orders ahead)
‚Ä¢ Result: 35 minutes (capped and rounded)
```

### **Override Scenarios**
- **Express service**: Kitchen is running ahead of schedule
- **Equipment issues**: Temporary slowdown requires extended time
- **Special prep**: Complex customizations need extra attention
- **Staff levels**: Reduced crew requires conservative estimates

## Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Accurate expectations**: Customers get realistic wait times
- ‚úÖ **Flexible control**: Easy manual override when needed
- ‚úÖ **Reduced complaints**: Better time management = happier customers
- ‚úÖ **Operational insight**: See calculation factors to understand patterns

### **For Customers**
- ‚úÖ **Clear expectations**: Know exactly how long to wait
- ‚úÖ **Real-time updates**: See if estimates change
- ‚úÖ **Better planning**: Make informed decisions about ordering

### **For Platform**
- ‚úÖ **Data-driven**: Learns from order patterns and timing
- ‚úÖ **Scalable**: Works for any type of food business
- ‚úÖ **Transparent**: Calculation breakdown builds trust

## Future Enhancements
- **Machine learning**: Learn from actual preparation times to improve accuracy
