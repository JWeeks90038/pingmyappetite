# 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Deploy Password Reset Page

## The Issue
The password reset email is working perfectly and sending from `flavor@grubana.com` ✅, but when users click the reset link, they get a blank page because the reset page isn't uploaded to your website yet.

## The Fix
You need to upload the password reset page to your grubana.com website.

## Files to Upload

### 1. Upload This File to Your Website:
```
Location: e:\ping-my-appetite\reset-password.html
Upload to: https://grubana.com/reset-password.html
```

## How to Test After Upload

### 1. Test the Complete Flow:
1. In mobile app → Profile → "Send Password Reset Email"
2. Check email (should come from flavor@grubana.com) ✅
3. Click reset link → Should open https://grubana.com/reset-password.html ✅
4. Enter new password and submit
5. Return to mobile app and login with new password

### 2. The Reset Link Format:
```
https://grubana.com/reset-password.html?token=xxx&uid=xxx
```

## Current Status:
- ✅ **Email sending**: Working from flavor@grubana.com
- ✅ **Firebase Functions**: All deployed and working
- ✅ **Mobile app**: Updated to use custom reset function
- ❌ **Website page**: Needs to be uploaded to grubana.com

## What the Reset Page Does:
1. **Validates the reset token** securely
2. **Shows professional Grubana-branded form**
3. **Allows user to enter new password**
4. **Updates password in Firebase Auth**
5. **Redirects back to mobile app**

## Security Features:
- 🔒 **1-hour token expiry**
- 🔒 **One-time use tokens**
- 🔒 **Secure validation**
- 🔒 **Proper error handling**

## After Upload:
Once you upload `reset-password.html` to your grubana.com website, the password reset flow will be complete and professional users will get:

1. **Professional emails** from your verified domain
2. **Branded reset experience** on your website  
3. **Secure password reset** process
4. **Seamless return** to mobile app

The system is 95% complete - just needs the HTML file uploaded! 🚀
