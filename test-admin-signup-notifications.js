/**
 * Admin Signup Notification System Test
 * 
 * This file documents the implementation of admin notifications for new user signups.
 * When a new user signs up on the mobile app, both a welcome email to the user 
 * and a notification email to flavor@grubana.com are sent automatically.
 */

// Implementation Summary:

/* 1. New Function Added: sendAdminSignupNotification âœ“
   - Located in: shared/functions/welcomeEmailService.js
   - Sends notification to flavor@grubana.com when new users sign up
   - Includes detailed user information and role-specific details
   - Uses SendGrid with same configuration as welcome emails
   
   2. Enhanced Trigger Function âœ“
   - Modified: shared/functions/welcomeEmailTriggers.js
   - Now calls both sendWelcomeEmail and sendAdminSignupNotification
   - Maintains existing welcome email functionality
   - Added proper error handling for both email types
   
   3. User Type Detection âœ“
   - Customer (Foodie Fan): Basic user info, address, SMS consent
   - Mobile Kitchen Owner: Business details, cuisine, kitchen type, plan
   - Event Organizer: Organization info, type, website, description
   
   4. Admin Email Content âœ“
   - User identification (name, email, phone, user ID)
   - Signup timestamp with EST timezone
   - Role-specific additional information
   - Next steps and action items
   - Quick links to Firebase Console and Admin Dashboard
   
   5. Integration Points âœ“
   - Automatically triggers on new user document creation in Firestore
   - Works with all signup methods (web and mobile app)
   - Non-blocking - if admin email fails, user signup still succeeds
   - Maintains existing welcome email functionality

// Manual Testing Steps:

/* 1. Deploy Functions âœ“
   - Ensure Firebase Functions are deployed with latest changes
   - Verify SendGrid API key is configured in environment
   - Check function deployment status in Firebase Console
   
   2. Test Mobile App Signups
   - Create test account as customer in mobile app
   - Create test account as mobile kitchen owner
   - Create test account as event organizer
   - Verify welcome emails are received by test users
   - Verify admin notifications are received at flavor@grubana.com
   
   3. Verify Email Content
   - Check that admin emails contain correct user information
   - Verify role-specific details are included
   - Confirm timestamps are in EST timezone
   - Test links to Firebase Console and Admin Dashboard
   
   4. Error Handling
   - Test with invalid email addresses (should not break signup)
   - Verify signup continues even if email service is temporarily down
   - Check Firebase Function logs for proper error reporting
   
   5. Production Deployment
   - Test in staging environment first
   - Deploy to production Firebase project
   - Monitor first few signups to ensure everything works
   - Set up alerts for email delivery failures
